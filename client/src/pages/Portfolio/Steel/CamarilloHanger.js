                            This project is a private Jet facility in California.
                            It is a Butler building with an MR-24 roof system. The areas between the 2 hangers are a 2 story corporate office.
                            The Hanger door hardware and sheeting was installed by CK Labor. The clear span on this project is 180 lf.
                            This project is within 10 miles of the Pacific Ocean and the rain was a constant battle.
