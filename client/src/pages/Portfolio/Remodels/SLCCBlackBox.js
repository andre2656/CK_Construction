                            The work included modifications to two interior spaces to support the College's theatre arts program.  
                            The first is an existing former gymnasium space to be modified for use as a Black Box Theatre.  
                            Work in this area included installation of theatre lighting equipment, draperies, acoustic panels and 
                            batts, and various other modifications required for the new use.  
                            Mechanical sound attenuation was installed in the existing duct system.
                            
                            The second space was the existing art classroom.  
                            The work was to change this space for use as a "green room" and preparation room in support of the 
                            Black Box Theatre.  These modifications included plumbing for clothes washer and dryer, electrical 
                            for dressing tables, a non-bearing partition wall, and modifications to lighting.
