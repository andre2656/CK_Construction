                            This is a fabrication shop, with 2 overhead bridge cranes and multiple stationary cranes used to flip parts.
                            It is a design build project that includes a rail system to allow carts to move parts also.
                            This project was built while the other shops and the lay down yard was still in operation.
                            This project also had a high wind problem.
