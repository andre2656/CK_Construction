                            This project is our office of operation.  It is a Design / Build project.
                            We used 10,000 sf of conventional construction for the office and 4500 sf of Butler pre â€“ engineered building for the shop.
                            The roof is MR. 24.  All of the layouts, materials, and colors were decided by the Owner, Rob Checketts.
                            The entry with the unique stair case was done in house with CK labor and the venetian plaster was also finished by CK labor.
                            The office is class "A" office space.
