                            Phase I of the Escalante Heritage/Hole-in-the-Rock Center and Museum.
                            For over 20 years, a group of local citizens have been involved in a grassroots effort to build a facility to
                            preserve and promote the cultural history of the Escalante area.  In 2002, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints
                            donated nine and one half acres of prime land for the construction of a heritage center complex.
                            Paramount to this project is highlighting the story of the pioneer settlement of San Juan County by means of the legendary
                            Hole-in-the-Rock trail.  Few events in the history of the colonizing of the state of Utah can compare to the courage and
                            faith mustered by the members of the group that were called to complete this incredible journey.  CK Construction is proud to
                            have been involved in this project.
