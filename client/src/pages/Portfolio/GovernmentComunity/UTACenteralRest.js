                            This project consisted of construction of an embankment and foundation for a pre-manufactured building, including a new water and sewer line.
                            We had to transport the building from the UTA Clearfield Station to the new building site in Salt Lake City.
                            At the new site the building was set and secured and all plumbing connections and site improvements were made.
