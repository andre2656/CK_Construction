                            The Ashgrove bag house was constructed while the plant was shut down, requiring us to put 50 plus people working 24/7 for 12 weeks.
                            We saved 3 weeks time by erecting the new structure for the controls off site, then using a Manitowoc crane to move the structure 1000 feet to set it up on the bag superstructure at an elevation of 55 feet.
                            We also erected the scrubbing tower and sheeted the building. We also demolished the existing bag house.
                            We had no lost time injuries during this process.
