                            A Design / Build project consisting of a Butler Building, Mr- 24 roof system, and a Texture coat Style wall system.
                            The interior is a show room and office space.
                            The area where this was built proved to challenging because of high water tables, requiring de-water and structural fill to be brought in for the building pad.
